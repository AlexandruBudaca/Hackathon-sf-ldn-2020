            Many of the students on the CodeYourFuture course are unfamiliar
            with the world of software development within the UK and many have
            never held a technical job role before. See the Future is a way for
            students and graduates of the CodeYourFuture course to be matched
            with a range of opportunities provided by local businesses. This
            could be anything from a few hours of shadowing a professional
            developer or a tour of their office, all the way through to a
            studentâ€™s first technical job role. CodeYourFuture provides an
            8-month, full stack, web development bootcamp for asylum seekers,
            refugees and people from other disadvantaged backgrounds. Our
            students come from a huge range of backgrounds and varying levels of
            experience, but join together and form a community around a common
            interest in tech and coding. Many of our graduates have gone on to
            work in a range of roles such as both front and back end developer
            roles, at companies including the Financial Times, the BBC and
            Ticketmaster.

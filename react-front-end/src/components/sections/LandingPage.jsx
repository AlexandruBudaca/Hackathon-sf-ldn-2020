            See the Future is a way for students and graduates of the
            CodeYourFuture course to be matched with a range of opportunities
            provided by local businesses. This could be anything from a few
            hours of shadowing a professional developer or a tour of their
            office, all the way through to a studentâ€™s first technical job role.
            CodeYourFuture provides an 8-month, full stack, web development
            bootcamp for asylum seekers, refugees and people from other
            disadvantaged backgrounds. Many of our graduates have gone on to
            work in a range of roles such as both front and back end developer
            roles, at companies including the Financial Times, the BBC and
            Ticketmaster.
